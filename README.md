# GAA-2017-TouringMusician
Traveling Salesman Project

"In this unit, you will be implementing your own circular linked list to create an app that plans a tour route for a small band. The band manager will be lining up a list of locations to which the band is invited to play but, before settling on a date, the manager will try to order the gigs so that the band spends as little time driving from place to place as possible.

This is an example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem which is difficult to solve efficiently. If you have already studied NP-completeness, this problem is considered NP-hard. The easiest solution is to just consider every possible ordering of the gigs to see which one results in the least travel but evaluating each possibility is expensive as the number of gigs grow (what's the big-O time complexity of doing so?).

In this unit, we will be using a custom linked list to implement some heuristics that quickly find some (non-optimal) solutions to this problem."
